				<p className="text-base">
					We were the first company in Bangladesh to formulate medicines in soft
					capsule form for the purpose of maximizing absorption and retention
					properties of some particular medicines such as vitamins. We continue
					to lead in the field of soft gelatin capsule manufacture in
					Bangladesh. We were also the first in the country to produce a soft
					gelatin capsule vaginal suppository with anti-bacterial and
					anti-fungal properties branded under the name of GYNOMIX. Presently,
					we use our refined and modern production processes to export
					pharmaceutical products to many countries around the world.

					<p className="text-base">
						We formulate drugs for all age groups and genders in different
						dosage forms including capsules, tablets, syrups, suspensions,
						injectables, soft gelatin capsules, suppositories, creams, and
						ointments. We maintain two principles of unique supply chain
						management: formulating optimized versions of medicines for specific
						patient groups and adopting policies for market release immediately
						after production. These policies benefit both the patients and the
						pharmacies as the medicine delivery system extends the productâ€™s
						lifecycle. Our formulating principles have always revolved around
						the health and welfare of patients. We constantly strive to improve
						the quality of life of our patients and customers.
